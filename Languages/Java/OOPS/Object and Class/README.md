# Classes and Objects in Java

I'm not repeating all the typical stuff such as conditionals and what objects and classes are. Some syntax, perhaps but not the rest.

## Naming conventions

1. Class - Start w/ upper case letter. Should be a noun.
2. Interface - Start w/ upper case letter. Should be an adjective.
3. Method - Start w/ lowercase letter. Should be verb.
4. Variable - Start w/ lowercase letter. Multiple words to be done in camel case.
5. Package - Lowercase, words sep by dots
6. Constants - All upper case letters
