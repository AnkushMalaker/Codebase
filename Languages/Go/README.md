### Go knowledge that I have understood

Firstly, a good (comparison)[https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/rust-vs-go#:~:text=Rust%20is%20a%20low%2Dlevel,focused%20on%20safety%20and%20performance.&text=Go%20is%20an%20open%20source,%2C%20reliable%2C%20and%20efficient%20software.] betwen rust and golang.

I'm mostly going to try to learn atlesat the sysntax of both languages as I feel it'd make me more comfortable when exploring different people's work and understand those technologies.
