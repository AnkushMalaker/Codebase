# Ownership

The is the core idea that allows rust to be safe and work without a garbage collector.  
One important thing that is distinct from others is the _ownership_ part. I'd suggest checking out the [part on it in the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html) itself becasue it does seem a little complicated.
