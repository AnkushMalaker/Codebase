### Rust knowledge that I have understood

Firstly, a good [comparison](https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/rust-vs-go) betwen rust and golang.

I'm mostly going to try to learn atlesat the sysntax of both languages as I feel it'd make me more comfortable when exploring different people's work and understand those technologies.

I'll be making notes from this book. It really should be enough to read through it seeing how expansive it is, but I'll make notes of things that will be hard for me to remember or anything that I feel is worth taking a look at later.

We also have [code](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/tree/master/src) for the [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

Stuff I need to circle back to:

- [x] More on crates
- [x] Automated Tests
- [ ] Traits
- [x] Lifetimes
- [ ] Closures
- [ ] RefClee
