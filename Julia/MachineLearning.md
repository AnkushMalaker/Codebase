# Machine Learning stuff in Julia  

### Calling python packages  
This can be done using PyCall package.  
To call numpy, we do:  
```np = pyimport("numpy")```  
Then, use np as usual.  

### We can use skitlearn etc as usual 

Wow, there isnt much to write here. I'll check if its possible to use tensorflow etc on Julia and put it in here. I don't really see a reason for it just yet, but we shall see.
